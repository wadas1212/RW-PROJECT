Both client.py and ransom.py should be one python code, but client.py should be run first before python.py
UNIQUE CODE IN CLIENT.PY SHOULD BE SHOWN IN THE RANSOMNOTE, WHICH IS THE SAME AS EMAIL_ME.TXT
EMAIL_ME.txt which is to be on desktop should be moved to the folder that should zipped before zipping,
this means that the zipped folder should contain Info.txt and EMAIL_ME.txt
